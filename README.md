# MeanWorkshop
This is the source code for the MEAN Workshop I gave in March of 2016.

It's organised into a few key sections.

1. `01/` Getting started with key concepts of Angular (1.5.x) (The "A" in MEAN)
1. `02/` More advanced Angular stuff
1. `03/` Working with NodeJS and Express (The "N" and "E" in MEAN).
1. `04/` Putting it all together with Mongodb (The "M").

This was only a four hour workshop, it's a bit light in some places â€” I assume you are comfortable with Javascript,
and can figure out how to get a Mongodb database running, although my slides DO cover that as well.

Feel free to file issues and bugs and I'll do my best to track them down.
